# 📊 Sales Data Analysis – SQL Project

---

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how **SQL** can be used to clean, transform, and analyze sales data. Starting with a raw dataset (**Online Sales Data.csv**), the workflow includes **data cleaning**, preparing a new table (`orders_clean`), and executing multiple queries to extract valuable business insights.  
The final results are saved for **further reporting** or **dashboard creation**.

---

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **Online Sales Data.csv** – Original dataset containing raw sales records.  
- **Query1.png to Query9.png** – Screenshots of SQL queries and their execution results.  
- **Task6 Sales_Analysis.sql** – SQL script containing all queries in sequence for replication.  
- **Task6 Results.csv** – Final cleaned and aggregated results from SQL analysis.

---

## 🛠️ Process Workflow

**1. Data Import** – The CSV file is loaded into a database for SQL operations.  

**2. Data Cleaning** –  
- Removed duplicates.  
- Handled missing values.  
- Extracted relevant fields (`Order Date`, `Amount`, `Product ID`, etc.).  
- Created a cleaned table named `orders_clean`.  

**3. Data Analysis Queries** –  
- Monthly revenue calculations.  
- Order counts by month.  
- Insights on sales trends.  

**4. Result Export** – Saved cleaned and aggregated results as CSV for sharing or visualization.

## 📊 Key Insights Obtained
- Monthly total revenue and trends.  
- Order count variations over time.  
- Basis for creating dashboards in tools like **Tableau** or **Power BI**.
